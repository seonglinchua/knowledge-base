## 🧮 Example Calculation

**Scenario**: Loan amount is SGD 100,000 for 5 years at 8% annual interest rate.

Monthly EMI = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n-1]
Where: P = 100,000, r = 8%/12 = 0.667%, n = 60 months

EMI = 100,000 × [0.00667(1.00667)^60] / [(1.00667)^60-1]
≈ SGD 2,027.64

Total Interest = (EMI × n) - P = (2,027.64 × 60) - 100,000 ≈ SGD 21,658
